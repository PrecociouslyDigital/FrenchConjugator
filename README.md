FrenchConjugator
================

This is a horribly, horribly written java app to test oneself on french conjugations and vocab.

In a conjugation file, start with the infinitive, then the Je, tu, il, nous, vous, ils forms, all seperated by spaces.
aller vais vas va allons allez vont
In a definition file, start with the definition, then a semicolon, then the answer.
to combat; combattre
